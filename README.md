# Hello there, I'm Karen :hand: :computer:
<img src="https://github.com/KarenEfereyan/KarenEfereyan/blob/master/gitemoji.png">
I'm a nerd but I don't wear glasses. Codeply is better than Codepen. I don't argue. I am a full stack developer.  I recently became familiar with the open source industry and I am enthused by it. Lately, I have begun to contribute to really amazinf open source software like meshery, and forem on which [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) is built. Having recently caught the design bug, I have been playing around with some designs on Figma. I enjoy writing technical articles as a means of spreading knowledge. Check out my [dev](https://dev.to/developerkaren) and [hashnode](https://karenefereyan.hashnode.dev/) powered blog for a range of helpful content. I am highly involved in community. Of special mention is the [Code Clan Nigeria](http://codeclannigeria.dev/) community which was pivotal in my growth as a developer. I stand with women in tech and hope to one day have a tech show of my own where I invite developer who have defied all norm to achive their coding dream. I am also currently teaching my 66-year old mother how to code and she is making steady progress.
