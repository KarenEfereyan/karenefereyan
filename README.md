<p>I am an empathetic full-stack developer currently based in Nigeria. I create software that solves real human problems. I want to be involved in every aspect of a software product's development lifecycle, from design, to deployment and everything in between.</p>

I'm a nerd but I don't wear glasses:rocket:. Codeply is better than Codepen. I don't argue. I am a full stack developer.  I recently became familiar with the open source industry and I am enthused by it. Lately, I have begun to contribute to really amazing open source software like meshery, and forem. Having recently caught the design bug, I have been playing around with some designs on Figma. I enjoy writing technical articles :book: as a means of spreading knowledge.I am highly involved in community building.I stand with women in tech and hope to one day have a tech show of my own where I invite developer who have defied all norm to achive their coding dream. I am also currently teaching my 66-year old mother how to code and she is making steady progress.
