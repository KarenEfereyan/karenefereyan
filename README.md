# Hi! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi"> I'm Karen

<p>I am an empathetic full-stack developer currently based in Nigeria. I create software that solves real human problems. I want to be involved in every aspect of a software product's development lifecycle, from design, to deployment and everything in between.</p>

Lately, I've become passionate about open source and the magic that happens when empathetic people come together to create software that humans use. I love sharing knowledge on technical issues on my [dev.to](https://dev.to/developerkaren) powered blog. I create content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yjCuOfEfXRoXGJI7aHAXg/about?view_as=subscriber) and I love to cook.

- ðŸ˜„ My Pronouns: She/Her/EfereyanK 
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [**Keeper**](https://github.com/KarenEfereyan/keeper) ( A minimalist version of google keep. Working to make it as close as possible! Hahaha ).
  
- ðŸ’» My favorite git command,  `git commit -s -m "Signed off DCO"` I got so used to signing off commits during my work in open source that I now do it for all my personal projects too.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Open Source and React.
  
-  How to reach me: [Visit my portfolio](https://karenefe.netlify.app)
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know how to cook. If we ever meet, don't ask me to buy you a cup of coffee. Ask me for a steaming plate of my signature 7-spirited Nigerian porridge. Your life will never remain the same. I promise.
