# Hi there, beautifully looking homosapien
My names are Efereyan Karen Simisola. I am a web developer living in Kwara State, Nigeria. 
I love to create aesthetically pleasing and functional web products ranging from websites 
to web applications. Recently, I built a blogging application using Laravel and a music app using vuejs. 
Currently, I am on my 100daysofcode journey with my mother. I am learning 
Reactjs and it's been really fun. I have my [portfolio](https://karenefe.netlify.app) where you can check out some of my recent projects.
I also document my learning on my hashnode powered [blog](https://karenefereyan.hashnode.dev/)

When I'm not coding, I like watching movies and teaching my mother how to code
