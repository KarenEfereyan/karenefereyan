## Welcome to my secret corner:
* Pronouns : She/Her :woman:
* I am currently documenting :books: my learning journey on my hashnode-powered :pencil: [blog](https://karenefereyan.hashnode.dev)
* I am teaching my 66year old [mother](https://twitter.com/PatienceEferey1) how to code and she is making steady progress :rocket:.
* I run a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=karen+efereyan) :microphone: where I make content related to web development. I also want to bring on developers of different experience levels to talk about things they've faced in their journey so that newbie developers can relate with them.
* I am making a conscious effort to connect to developers around the world :checkered_flag: Let's collaborate on small react and basic frontend projects
* I enjoy watching movies. Korean dramas :dvd: are my absolute favorite.
